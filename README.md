# SwiftDataGolfScorecard
A mini-golf scorecard app using SwiftData and SwiftUI. I am working on a course to teach people how to make apps with iOS 17. This is hopefully an app that will be included in the course. It took a lot of work to get the SwiftData stuff running and compliling so I thought I'd share this with others as a real-world example of how to use SwiftData.
